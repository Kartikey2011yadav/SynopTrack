# SynopTrack 📍

**SynopTrack** is a next-generation real-time location and presence platform designed to make coordination feel organic, emotional, and efficient.

> 🔄 **New Architecture Strategy**: We are transitioning from screen-based navigation to an **Engine-based Architecture**. See [docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for the detailed 7-Phase Roadmap.

## 📚 Documentation

## 🎯 Core Concept

A "Living Map" of your social circle.

- **Ephemeral Context**: Stories and chat that disappear.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose (Material3)
- **Architecture**: MVI / Clean Architecture (Engine-based)
